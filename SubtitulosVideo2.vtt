00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Well, well, everyone, what's up, how

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.830
are you? My name is what it tells me. I'm a

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.049
Spanish chess grandmaster and today I'm

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.250
going to teach you how to play chess. You already

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.080
know that the series have a reputation for being

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.969
difficult or complicated, but

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.099
you're not going to see that at all.  The rules are very

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.130
simple and we will all know how to

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.960
play chess well, considered by

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.779
many as a sport, as a science,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.820
as an art and it is played between two

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.109
people. It is played between a white side

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.080
and between a black side and the objective

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.420
which you can give it.  checkmate our

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.800
rival, just like in soccer we have to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.149
know the playing field,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.640
for example, soccer knows where

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.920
the goals are, there is where the central circle is,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.750
s3 center the corners, well, the same

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.920
in chess, chess is played on an

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.110
8 x 8 board  As you can see here with 64

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.329
squares 8 x 8 64

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.690
we know the multiplication table well and then

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.079
notice that there are what are called

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.850
columns in chess, right, then

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.829
there are the rows

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.809
and this is going to be enumerated just like the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.430
boats, we don't know the move.  from that game

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.199
where you put some little boats in a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.759
coordinate system and then you had to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.920
sink it because here the

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.470
notation system is exactly the same, it is numbered

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.140
from a to h

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.759
okay and from 1 to 8 in this way

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.190
this box here in the corner

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.200
left because it would be 1 truth and for

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.729
example this one here because it would be the one that I'm

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.930
sure I already had divine at home

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.220
it would be c3 truth

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.420
abc 1 2 and 3 well also on a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.039
chess board there are what are called

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.750
diagonals truth we have talked about  the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.280
rows of the columns and then there are the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.670
diagonals, for example this diagonal

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.200
would be at 1 h 8. Another very

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.970
important thing that you have to know when you are going to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.740
start playing chess is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.350
that there always has to be a small

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.899
white square on the right.  this way

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.369
this would be completely wrong so you

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.650
can't play chess right because there is

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.810
a black square on the right and

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:58.510
so on correct incorrect correct beige

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.040
white square on the right well

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.310
once we have known the

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.160
playing field we will begin to see how it is

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.530
they move the pieces okay and then we have to know

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.899
what the initial configuration is like on a

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.350
chess board the first piece that

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.560
we are going to know is the tower okay there are

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.099
four towers in chess

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.110
what is the initial position they are placed in

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.880
the corners that is, in the squares at

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.220
1 h 1 h 8 and at 8 how the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.349
towers move the towers move as many

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.420
squares as you want horizontally and

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.420
vertically, that is to say, notice that the tower

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.800
is very good because it can move through

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.480
many squares up to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.130
infinity, it cannot go until  portugal

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.950
because because there are limits on the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.709
board, really, pay attention, so at

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.780
most the rook can go up to h 8, it must be

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.390
said that of course if there are

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.250
pieces on the path you cannot jump over them,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.989
the rook is not a piece that can

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.600
assault its companions.  The only piece

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.420
that can jump to its partner is the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.310
knight, so if you have a piece from

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.650
your same side, at most you can reach

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.200
one square before and if you have a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.030
piece from the opposite side on the way you

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.900
can eat it but in no case

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.060
can you jump it.  okay,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.950
you can get up to here or you can

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.019
eat it and in that case the rook

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.500
will be on the square where that

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.989
enemy piece was okay then remember

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.349
horizontal vertical as many squares as

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.470
you want so this would be the rook

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.400
let's go with the bishop the bishops there are two

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.790
bishops per side too  the imps

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.400
look at each other one another is in the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.379
initial position of the bishops the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.629
bishops how it moves well they

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.129
move diagonally there is a bishop with

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.989
white squares that only moves along

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.120
the white diagonals true that is,

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.430
the film can move along  this

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.810
diagonal or for this truth

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.090
equally the black square bishop

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.489
how many squares the bishop can move

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.159
as many as you want it is worth for example if

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.129
the bishop is on f1 or if there is a bishop if

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.680
there is a bishop on the f3 square well then

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:10.639
this the film is  You can move either on

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.470
this diagonal or on this other one, it is valid

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.000
both forwards and backwards,

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.239
equally

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.829
here the same rule applies that

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.070
with the towers decision against there is

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.560
a piece on your side in the way you

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.990
can never jump over it, we said that

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.760
The knight, the colt, is the only piece

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.250
that is capable of jumping over its companions,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.710
at most it could reach one

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.290
square before your side's piece,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.060
and the same as we have said before,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.640
if you find a piece in the path

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.810
of the enemy side, the  you can samper

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.880
right boom it would be a bishop for b 7 you can

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.580
get to a square before or you can

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.490
decide to eat hello these would be the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.270
bishops let's go with one of the most

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.530
complicated pieces that exist in accessing the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.600
knights which are my favorites because

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.600
because the knights are very good

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.919
pieces  to trick your

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.419
opponent, but we will see this much

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.130
later because this is quite

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.740
complicated. Note that there are also two

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.450
knights per side in chess and they are

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.550
placed in these squares right next

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.930
to the towers, okay, right next to the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.580
corners in the square.  c1 b1 g8 and 8

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.470
how do horses move

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.400
some of you may be asking because they move in it

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.840
there is a good very simple rule to

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.430
explain how horses move

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.210
look which horse has three syllables

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.900
no here goes I so you can do it like this

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.060
here goes I don't know  move in l that

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.650
is to say you can move one

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.630
horizontally and two vertically

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.289
later or the other way around

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.360
you can move two vertically and one

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:51.520
horizontally notice that it is always one l

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.879
here goes I I

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.970
I will follow me okay then in l one l

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.430
towards here another direction  and another l went

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.259
there, but what about the horses? Well,

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.710
they noticed that it is a very

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:08.740
jumping piece. If you have an enemy piece or

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.750
your side's piece in the middle, then if

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.120
you can jump it, that is to say, this horse

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.060
can do here here and here and

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.639
you can jump it is worth it if

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.520
there is an enemy piece because you can

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:25.870
jump to that pawn

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:28.820
here I go and it is able to jump it is worth it

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.650
as it is captured because in the same way

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.600
as with the other pieces that is to say if there is

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.370
an enemy piece in a piece where  that

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.300
knight can land because you

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.729
can protect it without a problem 1, 2 and 3 and

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.770
as the queen it is worth remembering the

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.930
knight, the only piece that is capable of

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.060
jumping its rivals, what

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.889
else we have, we have seen the

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.479
bishop, we have seen the knight and we have

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.300
Having seen the rook, we go with the two

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.680
most important pieces of chess, the queen and the

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.229
king. It's worth

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.539
paying attention, there is one queen per side,

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.340
only one king per side that you have to

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:03.830
take care of as if they were

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.380
your children because because they are super

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.150
important, okay, let's try.  To

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.220
explain how the queen moves first,

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.690
okay, let's forget about the kings. First,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.550
let's see how the queen moves. The

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.580
queen is the best piece on the board by

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.470
far. It is the master of the board because it

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.860
can move in any

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.430
direction and the squares it  you want, that

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:28.009
is, it can move both vertically,

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:30.259
horizontally and diagonally,

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.030
all the squares you want, that is,

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.940
it is a combination of the rook and the

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:37.250
bishop. Remember that the rook moved

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.660
horizontally and vertically and the bishop

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.460
moved diagonally, well.  The queen in the

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.440
combination in the fusion would not agree with

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.720
those Dragonball functions where

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.639
Goku and Vegeta merged because here it

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.500
would be a fusion of the rook and the bishop

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.539
because it can move in

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.380
any direction and the squares which

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:53.570
means that it is

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:57.140
a super piece  Importantly, the one that is

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:59.420
worth the most is worth 9 points so we repeat

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:02.240
because you can move diagonally as many

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.730
squares as you want, vertically and

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.340
horizontally. Ok, let's give an example

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.350
so that you can learn how to move the queen.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.680
Imagine that a white queen

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:16.670
is on square 4 and  that there is a

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.710
black rook on b 7 and a pawn on b 4 what pieces

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:21.320
can we capture or imagine that

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.870
there is also a bishop jan ephe 7 and it is

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.780
white's turn because white could capture the

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.160
rook must 7 true because it is capable of

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.590
moving diagonally  could

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.300
also capture the pawn should 4 that would not be

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.220
too good an idea because because

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.800
then black could capture t the

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.200
queen later simply that

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.729
remember queen can move for all

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.910
the horizontal vertical and diagonal

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:48.710
let's go with the king the king is the most

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.360
important piece  of the seder is because because

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.160
if not so checkmate not so checkmate

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.570
the king and we lose the game so we have

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.180
to take care of it very very well

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.860
because there is a king on each side and the king is

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.630
the same as the queen but with many

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.670
restrictions the king  can move in

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.310
any direction but only one

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.440
square we told him that the queen can

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.120
move vertically and

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.550
horizontally as many squares as we want

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.130
well the king can only move one square

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:17.580
diagonally but only one

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:21.480
square diagonally only one square one

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:23.310
square and one square vertically  It

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.430
can move but only one square

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:28.500
back and the same

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.230
horizontally to the left and right,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.850
so as you can see it can move to all

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.430
the surrounding squares but not

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.260
further and as I say, it is the piece that we have to

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.750
take care of and that we have  to put it

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.030
safely in the middle game with

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.010
something that we are going to call castling, which is

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.320
a defensive move to put our

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.240
king in a safe place, as I say, if

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.460
our king catches it, if our king is

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.960
checkmated, we run out, we run out.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.820
the business will be over ok we will have lost

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.940
the chess game

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.590
well then we are missing well anyone

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.240
who has ever seen a

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.070
chess game and this guy who is saying

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.540
this ugly thing that I have in front of the camera

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.820
is not talking to me about the

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:09.920
exact pawns we have  The pawns are the

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:12.060
smallest but very important

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.340
because the pawns protect

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.560
our largest pieces when starting a

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:21.360
chess game. You will see that

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:23.790
we have eight pawns for each side in

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.620
chess that are placed in the second

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.920
row. Ok, we are going to place it here. Look.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:32.100
how nice or chopin cillo here

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.770
three four five six seven and eight and in

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.500
the first row as you know the

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.330
biggest pieces will go of course the king goes on

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:43.140
e1 if the king is white it goes on the

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:45.360
black square the white queen goes on one  We are going to

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:49.790
place all the pieces so that

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:53.780
you can learn, okay, and the same goes for black,

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:55.640
look at the queen, the rook, the bishop and another

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.820
bishop and another rook. So, as I said, there

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:02.390
are eight pawns. The pawn moves only

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:05.600
one step vertically forward,

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:07.340
always with one exception and  This

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.200
exception is when the pawn is

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:12.230
in its starting position, it can

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.330
decide without moving a step or two, okay,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.740
that is, if the pawn is 2 in its

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.670
starting position, you can decide to

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:21.620
play in four or three, okay, yes, it

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.170
can always only be played.  move a pawn

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.510
in turns that many of

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.310
you will have always told hey pp that my

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.680
grandfather told me that I could move two

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.090
pawns at the same time to start a game

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.640
of saleh that is not possible it is a

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:38.570
tall tale' okay that is directly illegal so

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.430
only one pawn per turn

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.810
one piece per turn ok no one

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:45.380
does this to me about the two pawns because that doesn't

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:47.900
exist so I see one step except with the

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:50.240
exception that the pawn is in

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.370
its initial position which can move in

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.329
two steps here you can  decide to play

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.189
efe 4

00:11:54.329 --> 00:11:57.899
but once black responds to you,

00:11:56.189 --> 00:11:59.670
for example with the move of 6th you

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:01.860
can no longer move the pawn two steps again

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.929
when they have already moved the pawn you

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.839
can only move it one step okay

00:12:03.929 --> 00:12:09.569
then imagine that he decides to play three out

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:13.049
of six  Now you can only move the pawn one

00:12:09.569 --> 00:12:15.239
step if of course any other pawn

00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:17.970
as it has not been moved yet you can

00:12:15.239 --> 00:12:19.860
move the two steps but

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.540
we have not said the pawns as capture because for

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.429
example imagine that we reach this

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.829
position the pawns are blocked

00:12:23.429 --> 00:12:28.499
because because they do not capture  vertically

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:31.439
ok you can't do this move the

00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:34.499
pawns eat from the side and that is to say when

00:12:31.439 --> 00:12:37.980
a rival pawn is placed on a square

00:12:34.499 --> 00:12:40.319
in front of ours and from the side

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.629
then we can eat that pawn

00:12:40.319 --> 00:12:44.960
ok this would be a pawn of five and this

00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:46.820
would be sport of  5

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.670
so for example if now black

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.450
plays 6 then we could eat that

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:54.170
pawn

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:56.240
ok but remember that you can't

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:59.180
eat this pawn so it has to be

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.800
one row ahead ok to say if for

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.020
example now white's black

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.180
juan cavallo efe 6 you don't  you can eat

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.640
this pawn this pawn would have to be

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.500
either on 6 or on c 6 to be able to be

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.240
captured okay then just

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.630
remember that the pawns move

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.760
forward but they capture from the vale ready

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.470
so these are the rules of chess

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.970
it may sound a  not very difficult but as

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.270
you can see just move palante

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:25.370
backwards diagonally nl there is no better

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:27.560
horizontal vertical remember pawn one

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.660
step by step diagonal bishop rook

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.460
horizontal vertical queen for all sides

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:35.240
king for all sides but only one

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:36.470
square knight nl so that's it then

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.760
nothing  I hope you liked the

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.860
explanation and now we are going to look at some

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.510
slightly more difficult concepts that

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.310
we still have left to know how to play

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.090
chess perfectly. Don't leave

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.090
until later.
