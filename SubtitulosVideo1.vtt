00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:16.820
ah

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:21.050
[Music]

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.900
is an unclear game, no, people

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.800
say it is not a sport because it is

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.500
much more than that, it is art, it is passion, it is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.590
a war of minds

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.640
64 squares, 16 pieces per side, the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.870
objective is to send the king, the game

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.940
is not science.  a sport, but I ask, is there

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.180
something stronger and more powerful in the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.580
human body than the brain? Chess is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.680
boring, but of course it seems

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.420
boring to you. If you don't know what it feels like to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.610
sacrifice the queen to mate in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.370
four moves, you don't know what it is.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.769
promote a pawn with ten seconds on the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.659
board and win the game

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.510
if you don't know what it's like to mate with two

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.250
knights and a pawn

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.250
if you haven't seen cal they have gained a

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.740
position that the computers evaluated

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.230
as a draw of course chess

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.630
seems to you  boring

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.800
it doesn't matter if you are a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.840
professional or amateur chess player you play chess

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.210
you make mistakes you lose due to time in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.150
a position won when bliss you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.740
left the rook on move 20

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.960
you demand a masterful move that not even

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.080
Kasparov himself, with the help of signing,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.520
would have seen before  next time you don't see

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.920
the mate in two, how clear it was, you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.860
go up and down from it or you feel like the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.070
best and the next day he loses five

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.270
games in a row as possible. I'm

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.090
so bad, but when you play chess you never

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.060
lose, my friend, I've practiced a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.250
new opening.  I watched ten videos I read a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.920
complete book and I practiced against the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.530
machine many times I am ready to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.930
win

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.290
well maybe this opening is not my

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.230
style I will try others that's how it is in

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.680

pawns  I won

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.840
by analyzing the game later

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.780
stop fish told me that chess is

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.700
wonderful as a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.470
game whose possible variants exceed

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.610
the number of atoms in the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.950
known universe cannot be beautiful. decisive advantage for the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.330
